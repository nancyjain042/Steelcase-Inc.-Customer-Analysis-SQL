# Key findings
1. Dominant Product Categories: The analysis reveals that office supplies consistently dominate sales across all regions, closely followed by furniture. This prevalence of office supplies suggests a corporate sector dominance in the customer base. The data further highlights that the "Binders" product subcategory holds a remarkable presence in all regions, with California leading the sales at 7.502 Million. The specific dominance of "Binders" in various regions signifies its strategic importance.

2. Regional Contributions: California emerges as a key contributor, generating the highest sales at 7.502 Million. Interestingly, different product subcategories dictate sales in specific regions. For instance, "Binders" dominate sales in the Central, East, and West regions, while the South region's sales are largely driven by "Paper". Notably, the corporate sector appears to dominate sales across most states, with Oklahoma standing out as a purely corporate-driven market, possibly due to its corporate-focused urban landscape.
